# UI Style Guide for Forms and Lists

- Use a minimal, clean, and modern design for all forms and lists.
- Backgrounds should be plain (e.g., `bg-white` for cards, `bg-gray-50` for the app background).
- Use a single column layout for forms, with tight vertical spacing (`space-y-4`).
- Form fields should have clear, simple labels and use shadcn/ui components (e.g., `Input`, `Label`).
- Buttons should be solid, rounded, and use the primary color (e.g., `bg-blue-600`).
- Error messages should be small, red, and placed directly below the relevant field.
- Use a card-like container for forms and lists, with subtle border and rounded corners (`border border-gray-200 rounded-lg`).
- Avoid unnecessary shadows, gradients, or extra decoration.
- For feedback, use toast notifications (see [login.tsx](mdc:src/routes/auth/login.tsx) for usage with `sonner`).
- See [login.tsx](mdc:src/routes/auth/login.tsx) for a concrete example of a minimal, modern form.
